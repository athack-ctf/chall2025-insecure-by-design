> In the spirit of "sharing is caring", InkHub was built to spread inspiring (and stylish) quotes to the world.
> Every user contributes their most precious thoughts (including the admin).
> But there's one thing the admin isn't willing to share: the flag.
> 
> With the credentials for the account `user` (password: `seru`), it's time to get creative.
> Your mission? Take over the admin's account and uncover what they're hiding. Rumor has it, the admin is *very* active on InkHub, posting every two minutes like clockwork.
