    In the spirit of "sharing is caring", InkHub was built to spread inspiring (and stylish) quotes to the world.
    Every user contributes their most precious thoughts (including the admin).
    But there's one thing the admin isn't willing to share: the flag.

    With the credentials for the account `user` (password: `seru`), it's time to get creative.
    Your mission? Take over the admin's account and uncover what they're hiding. Rumor has it, the admin is *very* active on InkHub, posting every two minutes like clockwork.
