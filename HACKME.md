Following the spirit of sharing is caring, InkHub was created for sharing inspiring (open) quotes to the world. 
Every user of InkHub is sharing their most valuable thoughts, including the admin. However, the admin keeps one thing
to himself: the flag.

Using the credentials the account "user" with password "seru", your goal is to take over the admin's account who seems
to be very active on InkHub (posts every 2 minutes or so).
