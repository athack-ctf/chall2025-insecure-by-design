In the spirit of "sharing is caring," InkHub was built to spread inspiring (and open) quotes to the world. Every user contributes their most precious thoughts — including the admin.  But there’s one thing the admin isn’t willing to share: the flag.

With the credentials for the account `user` (password: `seru`), it’s time to get creative. Your mission? Take over the admin's account and uncover what they’re hiding. Rumor has it, the admin is *very* active on InkHub — posting every two minutes like clockwork.
